* Minimal resource usage. Can work fine without external memory. F.e. it requires less then 40kb for color 320x240 display.
* All base controls: buttons, sliders, tabs and etc
* supports keyboard or touch input
* customisable - any color can be configured even in runtime
* EASY TO USE. Low barrier of entry and easy developing. Almost as simple as WindowsForms or etc

It supports batch drawing(two buffers: one wich contains all pixels with low pixeldepth and second smaller with display's native pixeldepth in which data will be rendered from first using palette and after that sended to display using DMA).

Existing drivers:
- 2.2 inch tft 240x320 on ILI9340C
- SDL2 for PC applications
You can easily write your own driver. Documentation(will be soon).
